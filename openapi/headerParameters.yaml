### REQUEST HEADER PARAMETERS
##########
requestId:
  name: X-Psn-Request-Id
  in: header
  description: Unique token used to identify each individual HTTP request. Must be in RFC 4122 UUID format. For example, if a user makes a call to get an access token, then makes a call to get a user's entitlements, each call would have its own unique request ID, although one could consider this as part of a single user session.
  schema:
    type: string
  example: 8600571b-e849-4f38-b256-1360f61754d4
  x-psn-api-audience:
    - internal-application

correlationId:
  name: X-Psn-Correlation-Id
  in: header
  description: Used for multiple client calls in a user session. The X-Psn-Request-Id has to be unique for every request, while X-Psn-Correlation-Id should be same for every call in a client session. Must be in RFC 4122 UUID format. The X-Psn-Correlation-Id, although similar to X-Psn-Request-Id, can be used to stitch together a user flow. If a user makes a call to get an access token, then makes a call to get a user's entitlements, each of these calls would have a unique request ID, however, one could use a single X-Psn-Correlation-Id to uniquely identify this user's session. Another use case could be a user's navigation through the PSN store, add to cart, and then purchase which could later be used to understand user behavior.
